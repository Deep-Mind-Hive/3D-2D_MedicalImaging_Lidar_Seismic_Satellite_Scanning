# Thermal Images

Thermal imaging is a non-destructive, non-contact and rapid system. It reports temperature through measuring infrared radiation emanated by an object/material surface. Automated thermal imaging system involves thermal camera equipped with infrared detectors, signal processing unit and image acquisition system supported by computer. It is elaborated in wide domains applications. Extensive focus is directed to the thermal imaging in the medical domain especially breast cancer detection. This chapter provided the main concept and the different applications of thermal imaging. It explores and analyses several works in the light of studding the thermograph. It is an effective screening tool for breast cancer prediction. Studies justify that thermography can be considered a complementary tool to detect breast diseases. The current chapter reviews many usages and limitations of thermography in biomedical field. Extensive recommendations for future directions are summarized to provide a structured vision of breast thermography. 



## Thermal imaging background

All materials/ objects that are at temperature above -273 degrees C (0 degrees Kelvin) emanate infrared energy. The emitted infrared (IR) energy from the measured object is converted into an electrical signal by imaging sensor. This imaging sensor is in the camera which connected to computer for displaying on a monitor the converted signal as a color or monochrome thermal image. The  IR  is  a form  of  electromagnetic  radiation  that  has  wavelength band  of  0.78  to 1000µm, which are longer than the wavelength of visible light and shorter than the radio waves. Several characteristics of the infrared radiation are similar to visible light, such as: the IR radiation can  be refracted,  focused,  reflected and  transmitted.  The  absorptivity,  emissivity, transmissivity, and reflectivity  of  infrared  radiation  vary for  different  objects/  materials.  Good  absorber  objects  for  the infrared radiation are also good emitters.  


#### Equipment that produces thermal image (Camera)


Thermal  imaging refers  to improve  objects visibility even  in a  dark  environment  by recognizing  the objects' infrared radiation as well as creating an image based on that information. Since, all objects emit heat (infrared energy) as a function of their temperature. This emitted infrared energy is known as the object‘s heat  signature  (Gaussorgues,&  Chomet,  2012).  Generally,  the  emitted  radiation  is  directly proportional to the object temperature (i.e. the hotter an object is, the more radiation it emits). Therefore, a heat sensor is required to detect tiny differences  in temperature. This thermal sensor  is essentially a thermal infrared (IR) camera (thermal camera) that collects the infrared radiation on the surface of the objects  under  investigation  and  produces  an  electronic  image  based  on  the  temperature  differences information. Additionally, thermal camera can detect different objects in the same view based on the object's different temperature, which make them appear as distinct objects in a thermal image.
